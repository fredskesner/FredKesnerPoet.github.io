The Pierian turn

The spring keeps its cool under a grammar of leaves—
each vein a line break, each sip a question.

I tilt the cup and the day tilts with it,
blue pouring through branches like a rumor.

A bee rehearses its single bright vowel.
Somewhere a library exhales the dust of first sentences.

If I listen too closely, the water begins to speak
in old syllables I almost remember—

not knowledge, exactly, but a hinge,
the door turning on light I had not asked to enter.

Lamplight over the river

Brisbane evening: the bridge rinsed in amber,
barges trading secrets with the tide.

A bat writes cursive above the ferry’s wake,
ink trailing, soft as breath on glass.

In the café window our reflections practice
being older—gentler at the edges, perhaps.

Your laugh breaks like a match struck twice,
brighter the second time for trying.

We pocket the glow, two small lanterns
crossing home by different streets.


---

Parallel crosswalks

At the corner, the signal changes in two universes.
In one, I step out and a bicycle rings like a bell.

In another, I wait, and a child drops a coin
that rolls perfectly into my future.

I keep both versions in my coat,
little lungs of possibility breathing.

The road darkens, the road gleams.
My feet choose and choose again.


---

Museum of almosts

Here is the ticket I never bought,
stamped with a city I loved from a distance.

A room of umbrellas unopened,
each rib holding back a tender weather.

Glass cases of names we nearly spoke—
if you lean in, the labels fog and clear.

Docents whisper: the exhibit is permanent,
but the hours change daily.

When I leave, the door decides to follow.
We both pretend not to notice.


---

Teaching the sky to spell

Chalk dust on my cuffs, I point to the board:
cloud, horizon, lift.

My students mouth the vowels of weather,
tongues tasting rain they can’t yet name.

An airplane commas the sentence of noon,
pausing to mean more than metal.

We practice the grammar of leaving and return,
syntax of wings in the throat.

Every lesson ends with a window open:
please spell home, however it arrives.


---

Paper satellites

Night folds itself into a square of listening.
I crease the corners, launch another wish.

Above the fig tree, a quiet orbit of plans:
each small moon a desk lamp burning late.

We are cartographers of what-if,
ink finding coasts that weren’t there before.

When the wind changes, I retitle the map
and keep sailing, steadfast as a rumor.


---

Anise and ozone

A storm lifts its sleeves over the suburbs,
steam and spice rising from bitumen.

Your kitchen is all thunder and laughter,
a pot teaching fennel to sing.

Lightning alphabets the blinds.
We read in flashes, fluent for seconds.

Afterwards the street is rinsed clean,
and the air tastes like beginnings we can swallow.


---

Grimoire for a future self

On page one: a leaf, brittle as good advice.
On page two: a key, purpose unnamed.

I write a charm for refusing the wrong urgency,
a sigil for remembering the body’s tide.

Bind the spine with thread the color of dusk.
Tuck a train ticket where the heart would be.

If you find this later, years folded like receipts,
read aloud. The door will practice opening.

Notes

• Tone and themes: Memory, place, pedagogy, parallel realities, small rituals, and the felt texture of choice.
• Performance: Most pieces read clean aloud in under two minutes; “Museum of almosts” benefits from a measured pace.
